In the bustling city of Virelia, emotions weren’t just felt they were bought, sold, and hoarded like gold. Joy came in shimmering vials, anger in jagged shards, and love in delicate crystal flasks. The wealthiest citizens walked with radiant smiles purchased from the finest traders, while the poor bartered scraps of sorrow just to feel alive.
Liora was a young merchant, clever and ambitious, dealing in everyday sentiments: mild happiness, fleeting curiosity, a pinch of nostalgia. She never questioned the system until the day she stumbled upon a hidden cellar beneath her late grandmother’s shop. There, in the dust and shadows, lay jars of emotions she had never seen before: Wonder, Belonging, Empathy, and a swirling essence labeled simply as Hope.

Intrigued, Liora uncorked a vial of Empathy. The sensation hit her like sunlight breaking through storm clouds warm, expansive, and deeply human. For the first time, she felt the heartbeat of the city around her: the loneliness behind polished smiles, the silent ache beneath laughter bought on credit. These weren’t commodities; they were lifelines.

Driven by a force she couldn’t name, Liora began sharing these forgotten feelings freely. At first, people were suspicious—why give away what others charged fortunes for? But as Empathy spread, neighbors spoke again, laughter rang without price tags, and the sterile hum of commerce softened into something real.

Yet with every gift, Liora felt the weight of a truth pressing closer: emotions weren’t meant to be owned. They were meant to connect, to bind, to heal. The stash wasn’t treasure it was a reminder of what had been lost when humanity turned feelings into currency.

Her final act was daring. At the Grand Exchange, where the elite auctioned rare passions for staggering sums, Liora shattered the vial of Hope. It burst into a luminous storm, flooding the market with light that seeped into every soul. Contracts dissolved, ledgers burned, and for the first time in generations, people felt without paying.

As the chaos settled, Liora stood among a crowd no longer divided by wealth but united by something far greater. She realized the true power of emotions wasn’t in their trade it was in their ability to restore what no coin could buy: connection.
And in that moment, the world began to feel again.
