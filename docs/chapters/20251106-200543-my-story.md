In the realm of Somnalis, dreams were more than fleeting visions—they were the lifeblood of society. Harvested from slumbering minds, they shimmered in glass orbs, traded in bustling markets for wealth, influence, and even forgiveness. Dreamweavers, artisans of these ethereal fragments, shaped them into wonders or weapons, depending on who paid the price.
Lyra was one such dreamweaver, known for crafting illusions so vivid they could make kings weep. Yet behind her mastery lay a quiet ache: the world had grown hollow. People bartered away their deepest hopes, their tender memories, until families fractured and hearts turned cold.
One evening, while sorting through discarded dream orbs in her workshop, Lyra found something strange—a sphere unlike any she had seen. It pulsed with a soft, golden light, warm as dawn. When she touched it, the dream unfurled like a tapestry: two children laughing under a willow tree, their voices echoing with love. Then came the fracture—a bitter argument, a storm of words, and silence stretching across years.
The dream wasn’t just a vision; it was a bridge. It held the essence of remembrance, a rare and forgotten thread that could restore lost memories. Lyra realized its power: with this dream, she could mend the rift between two families whose feud had poisoned generations.
But choice weighed heavy. Sharing it meant surrendering something priceless—an artifact that could make her the most sought-after dreamweaver in Somnalis. Keeping it would secure her future. Giving it away might spark chaos, dredging up old wounds alongside forgotten love.
Lyra chose hope.
She carried the orb to the House of Veyra, one of the estranged families. As the dream dissolved into their minds, gasps filled the hall. Faces softened, tears fell, and memories bloomed like spring after endless winter. They remembered laughter, shared meals, promises whispered under starlight. And with those memories came a truth: the feud had been born of misunderstanding, not malice.
Word spread like wildfire. The other family came, hesitant but yearning. For the first time in decades, they embraced—not as rivals, but as kin. The dream had done what no treaty could: it healed.
Lyra watched from the shadows, heart swelling. She had given away her greatest treasure, yet gained something far richer—a world where dreams weren’t just currency, but connection.
And in that moment, she understood: some dreams aren’t meant to be sold. They’re meant to be shared.
