# Responsible AI & Security

StoryForge is built with responsible AI principles:

- **Content Moderation**: All submissions are checked by AI Foundry's safety filters.
- **Transparency**: Edits, illustrations, and stories are versioned in GitHub.
- **Upgrade Path**: This MVP uses basic security. To make it enterprise-ready:
    - Integrate with Azure Active Directory for SSO.
    - Use Azure Key Vault for secrets.
    - Add audit logging and monitoring for all agent actions.
    - Apply stricter content filters and regular model evaluations.
